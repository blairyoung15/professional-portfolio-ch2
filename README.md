## Description

Initially from a marketing agency, clients wanted a web page that follows accessiblility standards so that their website is optimized for search engines. The client needed their page to follow logical semantic structure within html elements and css elements. In addition, they also needed to add accessible alt attributes, sequential heading attributes and a concise descriptive title. 

This website was created to use for potential future employers while looking for qualifying candidates. This website was made to look similar to the mock-up given. The page follows logical semantic structure within html elements and css elements. The website page displays info about potential employee and previous completed projects. This page was also made to be responsive to different screen sizes. 

After review the mock-up, I sketched out the website page and what the structure should be. I made various sections first and then created parent and child classes within each section in order to create a more dynamic page that will be responsive to the various screen sized. Initially it was important to created the header with navigation. I worked down through the page according to semantic structure. 

Majority of the page has flex elements included in the sections in order to create appropriate responsiveness on different screen sizes. 


## Installation
