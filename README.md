## Description

Initially from a marketing agency, clients wanted a web page that follows accessiblility standards so that their website is optimized for search engines. The client needed their page to follow logical semantic structure within html elements and css elements. In addition, they also needed to add accessible alt attributes, sequential heading attributes and a concise descriptive title. 

I was given an exisitng file with html and css. Upon viewing the files, the first thing that needed to happen was to organize the html and css files to follow semantic style. I first went through the html file, starting with the head of the document to make appropriate changes. I added a title that was missing, "Horiseon" to reflect business name and also checked to make sure css stylesheet was properly connected in htlml file. I then moved to the body to make several changes. There was not an exisiting navigation section outlined, which I added along with the appropriate html elements to create an orderly navigation section including id tags for corresponding sections in the page. 

Further down the page, I created separate sections for the hero, contents and benefits and footer sections. Within each section, I cleaned up the code around the elements and make corresponding classes and ids that would make the page function and allow for well-defined styling in the css. 

Once the html document was cleaned up, I went into the css stylesheet and arranged the sheet to reflect semantic styling. Prior, the footer was not in the correct place, as well as class elements being mixed in with each other. By creating class and ids, I was able to consolidate a lot of the repetative classes throughout the document. Additional small styling changes were made to better reflect the mock-up given by the client.
